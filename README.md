## 📸 Overview

A beautifully designed coffee shop landing page based on a Figma concept.  
This project helped me improve my frontend design skills and learn how to translate pixel-perfect UI into real, responsive web components using **Tailwind CSS** and **React**.

> ✨ *This is my favorite project so far — clean, stylish, and fully responsive.*

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive layout (mobile → desktop)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- Real images and icon usage
- Clean React components
- Dummy "Order Now" buttons (Frontend-only)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

---

## ⚠️ Note

This project is **frontend only** — the "Order Now" and similar buttons are **non-functional** and used for UI purposes only.

I do **not own** the brand "Allowishus Delicious".  
This project was built **for learning and practice** based on a free Figma design.
